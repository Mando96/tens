Creating Tens game

To Play You Must Understand 3
Math Facts
1. Any number with a 0 in the ones place is a multiple of 10.
Ex: 10, 20, 50, 190, 730
2. If the ones place of two numbers add up to 10, the sum of the numbers will be a multiple of ten.
Ex: 48+32 = 80 or 53+97 = 150
3. If the ones place of two numbers are the same, the difference of the numbers will be a multiple of ten.
Ex: 84-24 = 60 or 75-25 = 50

--------------------------------------------------------
The goal of this game is for the 'Player' to identify if the result of the 'Addition' or 'Subtraction' 
of '2 Numbers' presented is a 'Multiple of 10' within a certain 'Time Frame'

How do you get points?
1. Identifying a multiple of 10 
2. Completing task within set Time 

Levels
1. Advanced: => 90sec e.g The timer will be set (30 pairings/questions * 3 secs) = 90sec
2. Moderate: => 120sec    30 * 4
3. Easy => 150sec
4. Number ranges => Random

What is needed for this project: 
1. A list: Need to be able to control the parameters. 
2. Timer: to time the game 
3. 2 variables to hold the comparing values
4. A way to check for multiples of 10
5. A way to check players anws are right or wrong 
6. A way to store players score
7. A way to store time 

New Modifications to be made:
1. 1 point for every correct guess on Multiple of 10: done
2. 0 point for correct guess on non-multiple of 10: done
3. end game after 3 wrong gueses: done 
4. if first pair is 5,6 then the next pair should be 6,x and the next should be x,y: y,z etc: done
5. Same numbers showing on the two sepreate decks
